# Predict Pokemon battles using Machine Learning

#### Purpose:
The purpose of this is to see if there is any way possible to predict the outcome of a pokemon battle. Granted all pokemon are the same level but each pokemon will have different attack, defense, and special attacks/defense. Gather the features and manipulate it to figure out if predicting a winner is possible.
